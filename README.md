## Purpose
Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset such as:
- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- Do students in more popular majors find it easier to get employed?
- Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?
- Is there any link between the number of full-time employees and median salary?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
- Which category of majors have the most students?
