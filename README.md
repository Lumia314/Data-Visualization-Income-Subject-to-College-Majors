# Data-Visualization-Income-Subject-to-College-Majors
#Introduction
We will explore a dataset in regards to income and career choice using visualization tools from Python

##Data description
The dataset is of students finishing college between 2010 and 2012. The data is collected by American Community Survey and has been provided courtesy of FiveThirtyEight.
There are 173 data points with 21 columns listed as below:
- Rank - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).
- Major_code - Major code.
- Major - Major description.
- Major_category - Category of major.
- Total - Total number of people with major.
- Sample_size - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.
- Men - Male graduates.
- Women - Female graduates.
- ShareWomen - Women as share of total.
- Employed - Number employed.
- Median - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.
- Low_wage_jobs - Number in low-wage service jobs.
- Full_time - Number employed 35 hours or more.
- Part_time - Number employed less than 35 hours.

##Purpose
Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset such as:
- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- Do students in more popular majors find it easier to get employed?
- Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?
- Is there any link between the number of full-time employees and median salary?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
- Which category of majors have the most students?
